This is a collection of similar data types.
It is in a closest memory place.


 One dimensional array:
 A one-dimensional array is like a spreadsheet with data in only one line.


 Syntax:

 dataType []arr; (or)

 dataType arr[];

 dataType[] arr; (or)

 dataType []arr; (or)

 Two Dimensional Array:
 In the Java software development language, two-dimensional array is like a spreadsheet with multiple rows and columns, each with different data in each slot.
 Each cell will be identified by its unique line and column index combination (e.g. SR 1 [3] [2]).
 We can use a two-dimensional array to store user IDs and passwords of different users.
 Syntax:

 dataType[][] arrayRefVar; (or)

 dataType [][]arrayRefVar; (or)

 dataType arrayRefVar[][]; (or)

 dataType []arrayRefVar[];

 dataType[][] arrayRefVar; (or)

 dataType [][]arrayRefVar; (or)

 dataType arrayRefVar[][]; (or)

 dataType []arrayRefVar[];
