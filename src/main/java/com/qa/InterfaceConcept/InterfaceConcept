Interface:
An interface in Java is a template of a class.
This collection of abstract methods means that all methods are abstract methods in the interface.
With abstract methods, an interface can also contain constants, default methods, static methods, and nested types.
The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve completely abstraction.
It can not be started like an abstract class.
